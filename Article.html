    <article><p>Recognising the complicated nature of the road 
    safety crisis, the network has been focusing on multiple 
    approaches towards the problem. We have been mainly looking
    at the following methods simultaneously with the aim of creating
    the greatest impact in least time.
    Policy Intervention and Advocacy
    At the policy level, India stands at a crucial point in terms
    of getting the outdated Motor Vehicle Act amended in the Parliament.
    At the State level, Maharashtra has made a state level Action Plan for Road 
    Safety, but little has been done to get it implemented. Pursuing its implementation
    has been one of our goals. The network has been tirelessly pursuing this process of
    passing the Motor Vehicle Amendment Bill in the Parliament.This also involves
    trying to constantly engage with policy makers, political representatives 
    and government officials for change.
    Citizen Awareness
    safety from time to time. This helps build a strong base for advocacy,
    along with the use and curation of existing data such as court cases,
